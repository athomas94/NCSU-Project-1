# NCSU-Project-1

For this project, I will be creating a wordle type game, where instead of guessing words, you'll be guessing characters from the popular game, World of Warcraft. I hope to implement a system that validates a users input against an array of "character" objects, in which 5 basic attributes about the characters will be present. 

1. Faction
2. Species
3. Gender
4. Class
5. First seen in Expansion

While I am confident in my abilities to create a word game like wordle, I think the real challenge here will be getting the functionality to work with an array of objects instead of a single word.
